# joke-generator

By using Python, I have made a simple and easy joke generator that takes a predefined user input (will be asked) and generates a random joke. This is possible because of pyjokes library used in this code. The pyjokes library randomly generates a one-line joke, which I implemented here using loops. 

The pyjokes library can be installed using this command:-

pip install pyjokes

For reference, I also referred https://github.com/pyjokes/pyjokes which helped me to get every information needed for knowing about the pyjokes library. 

Also, just for fun, for every end of the loop, I added some funny statements, as I didn't have any idea on how to end the loop ðŸ˜…. Also, please note that the code or the Python file given here is just an example of a prototype with CLI method, anything related to GUI is shelved for future purposes and real-time applications may also be implied in this project.
